# 🎵 Music Genre Classifier (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a **Music Genre Classification Model** using **Machine Learning**.  
The goal is to classify songs into their respective **genres** based on given features such as tempo, loudness, duration, and other audio-related attributes.  

By applying **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms**, the model predicts the genre of a music track with good accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset contains songs with extracted features and their corresponding **genre labels**.  
- Typical features include:  
  - `tempo`, `loudness`, `duration_ms`, `key`, `mode`  
  - Spectral features (e.g., `spectral_centroid`, `chroma`, `mfccs`)  
  - `label` → Genre of the song (target variable)  

*(Dataset source: Kaggle / GTZAN / Spotify API or other open-source datasets)*

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Performed EDA to understand the dataset:  
- Distribution of songs across genres  
- Correlation heatmap of audio features  
- Feature importance for genre prediction  
- Visualization of tempo, loudness, and duration across genres

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps  
- Handling missing values  
- Normalization/standardization of numerical features  
- Encoding categorical features (e.g., genre labels)  
- Splitting dataset into **train/test sets**  
- Feature scaling for ML models

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models  
Implemented and compared multiple classification models:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
